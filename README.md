### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a tech enthusiast based in Montreal, Quebec. I focus on Web Development, along with building progressive web apps using Vue. My work primarily focuses on creating intuitive user-facing applications that allow users to explore new ideas, information and express themselves. Additionally, I love collaborating with other developers and designers and enjoy learning new skills that I can apply in my work. When not coding or designing, you'll usually find me playing basketball or an online game.
